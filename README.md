# Module_2_Challenge
Module 2 Challenge 

## This is the README for the Module 2 Challenge for Sultan Raheem

## Within the submission there are screenshots for 2018, 2019, and 2020 results in the stock data

## There is also a BAS file for the VBA script and it is called Sub Stocks_Test

## This submission creates a script that loops and outputs results for all the stocks, it takes the Ticker name, Yearly Change, Percent Change, and Total Stock Volume

## It also calculates the Greatest Percent Increase, Decrease, and Greatest Total Volume

## It does this for all three sheets for 2018 to 2020

## There are also calculations and variables set for the ticker name, volume of stock, open/close price

## columns are also created for tickers, total volume, yearly change, and percent change through the script, further are created for greatest increase, decrease and greatest total volume through the VBA script

## Conditional formatting was also done in VBA to highlight the colours in the yearly change column

## This conditional formatting and all calculations ran for all three of the sheets that are in the Excel file

## One thing missing from this submission is the name of the ticker associated with the greatest % increase/decrease and greatest total volume
